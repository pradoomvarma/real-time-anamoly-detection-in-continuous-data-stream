## Explanation of the Chosen Algorithm

Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA): This algorithm calculates a weighted average of past data points, giving more weight to recent observations. This allows it to adapt quickly to changes in the data stream, making it effective for detecting anomalies in real-time.

Z-Score for Anomaly Detection: By calculating the Z-score of the incoming data points relative to the EWMA and its variance, the algorithm identifies points that deviate significantly from the expected behavior. A Z-score above a certain threshold indicates an anomaly.

## Effectiveness:

The combination of EWMA and Z-score is effective for detecting anomalies in data streams with noise and trends, as it can adapt to changes while still identifying outliers.

This approach is particularly useful in time-series data, where seasonal trends or changes in the underlying process may occur.

## Robust Error Handling and Data Validation:

The detect method includes error handling to avoid division by zero when calculating the Z-score.

The real_time_anomaly_detection function checks if the incoming data points are valid numbers before processing them.

An exception handler is implemented in the __main__ block to catch and report any errors during execution.

## How to Use:

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Python script:

python anomaly_detection.py

This will start the simulation and display the real-time anomaly detection.
